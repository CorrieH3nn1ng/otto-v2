## Package-Level Manifest Management

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Manifests work at PACKAGE level, not invoice level!

**What this means:**
- One invoice can have packages on multiple manifests (split shipments)
- One manifest can have packages from multiple invoices (mixed loads)
- You control which individual packages go on which manifest

### Add Packages to Manifest
1. Open manifest detail ‚Üí **INVOICES** tab
2. Click **+ ADD INVOICE**
3. Click the **Qty number** (e.g., "7") for the invoice
4. **Select specific packages** to add (not all required!)
5. Click "Add X Package(s)"
6. ‚úÖ Only selected packages assigned to manifest

### Remove Packages from Manifest
1. Open manifest detail ‚Üí **INVOICES** tab
2. Click the **Packages number** (e.g., "3") for the invoice
3. **Select packages to remove**
4. Click "Remove X Package(s)"
5. ‚úÖ Selected packages removed, others stay

### Understanding Package Status
- üü¢ **Green chip**: Package on this manifest
- üü° **Yellow chip**: Package on different manifest
- ‚ö™ **White chip**: Package not assigned yet

### Quick Examples

**Split Shipment:**
- Invoice IN018177 has 7 packages
- Add 3 packages to Manifest A
- Add 4 packages to Manifest B
- Result: One invoice split across two trucks

**Mixed Load:**
- Manifest S00037754 needs to fill capacity
- Add 2 packages from Invoice A
- Add 5 packages from Invoice B
- Add 3 packages from Invoice C
- Result: Optimized truck load from multiple orders
