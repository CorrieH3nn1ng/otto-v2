# Package-Level Manifest Assignment - Session Notes

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Core Business Logic

---

## üéØ Overview

Implemented **package-level manifest assignment** system that allows split shipments and mixed loads. This is a fundamental business requirement where packages from invoices can be assigned to manifests individually, not just at the invoice level.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BUSINESS RULE

### Package-Level Relationship Model

**The relationship between invoices and manifests operates at the PACKAGE LEVEL, not the invoice level.**

### Core Principles:

1. **One Package ‚Üí Many Manifests**
   - A single package can be assigned to multiple manifests (rare but possible)
   - Example: Package #1 from IN018177 on both S00037754 and S00037755

2. **One Invoice ‚Üí Many Manifests (Split Shipments)**
   - Packages from the same invoice can be split across different manifests
   - Example: IN018177 has 7 packages - 1 goes on Manifest A, 6 go on Manifest B

3. **One Manifest ‚Üí Many Invoices (Mixed Loads)**
   - One manifest can carry packages from multiple invoices
   - Example: Manifest S00037754 carries packages from IN018177, IN018186, IN018190

4. **Linking Mechanism: `packing_details.file_name`**
   - Stores the manifest_number to link package to manifest
   - Manual, user-controlled field
   - When added: `file_name = manifest_number`
   - When removed: `file_name = NULL`

---

## üìã Implementation Summary

### 1. Documentation Updates

**File:** `CLAUDE.md`
- Added prominent "‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BUSINESS RULES" section
- Explained package-level relationship model with examples
- SQL examples showing package assignments
- UI/UX implications documented

### 2. Backend API Endpoints

**File:** `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/ManifestController.php`

#### New Methods Added:

```php
// Lines 314-347
public function attachPackages(Request $request, int $id): JsonResponse
{
    // Updates file_name for selected packages only
    // Auto-syncs invoice relationships
    // Returns updated manifest with package details
}

// Lines 349-393
public function detachPackages(Request $request, int $id): JsonResponse
{
    // Clears file_name for selected packages
    // Auto-removes invoice relationship if all packages removed
    // Intelligent cleanup of orphaned relationships
}
```

**Routes Added:** `backend/routes/api.php` (Lines 111-112)
```php
Route::post('/{id}/attach-packages', [ManifestController::class, 'attachPackages']);
Route::post('/{id}/detach-packages', [ManifestController::class, 'detachPackages']);
```

### 3. Frontend Service Methods

**File:** `frontend/src/services/manifestService.js` (Lines 68-82)

```javascript
attachPackages: async (id, packageIds) => {
    const response = await api.post(`/manifests/${id}/attach-packages`, {
      package_ids: packageIds
    });
    return response.data;
  },

  detachPackages: async (id, packageIds) => {
    const response = await api.post(`/manifests/${id}/detach-packages`, {
      package_ids: packageIds
    });
    return response.data;
  }
```

### 4. Frontend UI Components

**File:** `frontend/src/components/ManifestDetailView.jsx`

#### Key Features Added:

**A. Add Invoices Modal Enhancements** (Lines 753-770)
- Added clickable "Qty" column showing total package count
- Clicking opens Package Selection dialog
- Visual indication with underline and hover effect

**B. Package Selection Dialog for Adding** (Lines 791-922)
- Shows all packages from selected invoice
- Multi-select checkboxes for individual packages
- Displays package details: #, Qty, Weight, CBM
- Shows current manifest assignment status with color-coded chips:
  - üü¢ Green: On current manifest
  - üü° Yellow: On different manifest
  - ‚ö™ Outlined: Not assigned
- "Add X Package(s)" button

**C. Package Management Dialog for Removal** (Lines 924-978)
- Accessed by clicking package count in INVOICES tab
- Shows only packages assigned to THIS manifest
- Multi-select checkboxes (red theme)
- Warning alert about invoice removal
- "Remove X Package(s)" button
- Auto-removes invoice if all packages removed

**D. Filtered Calculations** (Lines 333-364, 607-622)

Updated calculations to filter by `file_name === manifest?.manifest_number`:

```javascript
// PREVIEW Tab Totals
const calculateTotals = () => {
  // Only count packages assigned to THIS manifest
  const packingDetails = allPackingDetails.filter(
    pkg => pkg.file_name === manifest?.manifest_number
  );

  // Proportional invoice value calculation
  const proportion = manifestQuantity / totalInvoiceQuantity;
  totalValue += invoiceAmount * proportion;
}

// INVOICES Tab Display
const pkgs = allPkgs.filter(p => p.file_name === manifest?.manifest_number);
const packages = pkgs.reduce((sum, p) => sum + quantity, 0);
```

## üîç Technical Details

### Database Structure:

**Key Tables:**
- `packing_details.file_name` - Stores manifest_number (nullable)
- `invoice_manifest` - Pivot table tracking invoice-manifest relationships
- `manifests` - Manifest records with manifest_number

**Example Data:**
```sql
-- Invoice IN018177 has 7 packages
SELECT pd.id, pd.package_number, pd.file_name, i.invoice_number
FROM packing_details pd
JOIN invoices i ON pd.invoice_id = i.id
WHERE i.invoice_number = 'IN018177';

-- Results showing split shipment:
-- id=14, pkg=1, file_name='S00037754'  ‚Üí Manifest A
-- id=15, pkg=2, file_name='S00037754'  ‚Üí Manifest A
-- id=16, pkg=3, file_name=NULL         ‚Üí Not assigned
-- id=17, pkg=4, file_name='S00037755'  ‚Üí Manifest B
-- id=18, pkg=5, file_name='S00037755'  ‚Üí Manifest B
-- id=19, pkg=6, file_name='S00037755'  ‚Üí Manifest B
-- id=20, pkg=7, file_name='S00037755'  ‚Üí Manifest B
```

### Proportional Value Calculation:

When displaying invoice values on manifests, the system calculates proportional amounts:

```javascript
// If invoice IN018177 = ZAR 60,058.67 with 7 packages
// And only 3 packages are on this manifest:
const totalInvoiceQuantity = 7;
const manifestQuantity = 3;
const proportion = 3 / 7; // 0.4286
const manifestValue = 60058.67 * 0.4286; // ZAR 25,739.43

// Display shows: ZAR 25,739.43 (not the full 60,058.67)
```

## üéì Key Learnings

### Business Logic Insights:

1. **Package-level granularity is essential** for logistics operations
2. **Split shipments** are common when truck capacity doesn't match invoice quantities
3. **Mixed loads** optimize transport costs by combining multiple orders
4. **Proportional costing** provides accurate per-manifest value tracking

### Technical Insights:

1. **Filter calculations consistently** - Always filter packing_details by file_name when displaying manifest data
2. **Auto-cleanup relationships** - Remove invoice relationships when last package removed
3. **Visual status indicators** - Color-coded chips help users understand package assignment state
4. **Dual dialogs for add/remove** - Different UX patterns for different operations (add=blue/green, remove=red)

---

## üöÄ Performance Considerations

- Eager loading includes `packingDetails` to avoid N+1 queries
- Frontend filters packages in memory (fast for typical invoice sizes)
- Backend updates use `whereIn()` for batch package updates
- Invoice relationship sync uses `syncWithoutDetaching()` to avoid duplicates

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. **Bulk package operations** - Select packages across multiple invoices
2. **Package history tracking** - Audit trail of package movements
3. **Load optimization suggestions** - AI-powered truck loading recommendations
4. **Package barcode scanning** - Mobile app for warehouse operations
5. **Real-time capacity monitoring** - Show truck fill percentage as packages added

### Related Features (Documented Separately):
- Reporting system (see `REPORTING_REQUIREMENTS.md`)
- Daily Tracker with capacity tracking
- Loading Schedule by truck type
- BV & Freight Reconciliation

## üí° Important Notes

### For Future Developers:

1. **Always filter by file_name** when displaying manifest package data
2. **Never assume whole-invoice operations** - always think at package level
3. **Test with split shipments** - common scenario that must work perfectly
4. **Invoice removal is automatic** - backend handles it when last package removed
5. **Proportional values matter** - customers care about accurate per-manifest costs

### For Operations Team:

1. **Click Qty to manage packages** - both when adding and viewing
2. **Color indicators show status** - green=this manifest, yellow=other, white=none
3. **Remove individual packages** - don't remove whole invoice unless intended
4. **Calculations are automatic** - weight, CBM, value all update instantly
5. **Invoice disappears if empty** - removing all packages removes invoice
