3. **Visual Indicator**: Arrow shows current sort (‚Üë ascending, ‚Üì descending)

### Sortable Columns

#### Load Confirmations
- File Reference (alphabetical)
- Confirmation Date (chronological)
- Collection Date (chronological)
- Transporter (alphabetical)
- Vehicle Type (alphabetical)
- Truck Registration (alphabetical)
- Status (alphabetical)

#### Active Invoices
- Invoice Number (alphabetical)
- Date (chronological)
- Supplier (alphabetical)
- Customer (alphabetical)
- Amount (numeric)
- Stage (alphabetical)
- Owner (alphabetical)
- Status (alphabetical)

#### Purchase Orders

## Automatic Invoice Status Updates

### Load Confirmation Upload Workflow

When a load confirmation PDF is uploaded via the AUTO TRANSPORT REQUEST feature:

1. **PDF Processing**:
   - System extracts invoice number from handwritten load confirmation
   - AI (Gemini) reads handwritten text and vehicle details

2. **Auto-Population**:
   - Vehicle registrations (truck, trailer 1, trailer 2)
   - Transporter name and ID
   - Vehicle type (with intelligent suggestions)
   - Delivery address from invoice
   - Collection address
   - Agents (clearing and entry)
   - Driver information
   - Department contact defaults (e.g., KAMOA contacts)

3. **Automatic Status Update**:
   - Invoice status changes: `approved` ‚Üí `in_transit`
   - Invoice stage changes: `ready_dispatch` ‚Üí `in_transit`
   - Dashboard indicators update automatically
   - "Ready for Dispatch" count decreases
   - "In Transit" count increases

**Code Location**: `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/WebhookController.php:697-707`

---

## Data Refresh & Caching

### Cache Prevention

All API calls include timestamp parameters to prevent browser caching:
- Statistics endpoint: `/api/invoices/statistics?_t=<timestamp>`
- Fresh data on every dashboard load

### Manual Refresh

If you need to force refresh:
- **Windows**: `Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`

---

## Technical Implementation

### Backend API

**Statistics Endpoint**: `GET /api/invoices/statistics`

**Returns**:
```json
{
  "total_invoices": 43,
  "draft": 1,
  "stage_ready_dispatch": 40,
  "stage_in_transit": 2,
  "stage_delivered": 0,
  "load_confirmations": 2,
  "manifests": 0,
  "awaiting_qc": 0
}
```

**Code Location**: `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/InvoiceController.php:427-461`

---

### Frontend Components

**Dashboard**: `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`
- Displays 8 workflow indicators
- Auto-refreshes on tab change

**Filtering Logic**:
- Load Confirmations: `frontend/src/components/LoadConfirmationList.jsx:336-417`
- Invoices: `frontend/src/components/InvoiceList.jsx:113-196`
- Purchase Orders: `frontend/src/components/PurchaseOrderList.jsx:82-144`

**Sorting Logic**:
- Uses `orderBy` and `order` state variables
- Implements comparator functions for each data type
- Visual indicators with Material-UI icons

---

## Workflow Best Practices

### Typical Invoice Lifecycle

1. **Upload Invoice** ‚Üí Status: `draft` or `approved`
2. **Complete QC (if required)** ‚Üí Removes from "Awaiting QC"
3. **Approve Invoice** ‚Üí Status: `approved`, Stage: `ready_dispatch`
4. **Upload Load Confirmation** ‚Üí Status: `in_transit`, Stage: `in_transit`
5. **Create Manifest** ‚Üí Groups multiple load confirmations
6. **Mark as Delivered** ‚Üí Status: `delivered`, Stage: `delivered`

### Dashboard Monitoring

- **Morning Review**: Check "Ready for Dispatch" count
- **Transport Planning**: Create load confirmations for ready invoices
- **Transit Tracking**: Monitor "In Transit" count
- **Completion**: Verify "Delivered" count matches expectations

## Troubleshooting

### Indicators Showing 0 When Data Exists

**Symptoms**: Dashboard shows 0 for indicators that should have data
**Cause**: Browser cache holding old API response
**Solution**: Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + F5 or Cmd + Shift + R)

### Filters Not Working

**Symptoms**: Search returns no results
**Check**:
1. Verify exact spelling in search term
2. Clear search field and try again
3. Check if status/stage filter is too restrictive
4. Combine filters carefully (they use AND logic)

### Sort Not Responding

**Symptoms**: Clicking column header doesn't sort
**Check**:
1. Look for arrow indicator on column header
2. Some columns are not sortable (e.g., Actions, Equipment)
3. Refresh page if no response

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for consideration:

1. **Export Filtered Data**: Download filtered results to Excel
2. **Saved Filters**: Save commonly used filter combinations
3. **Advanced Search**: Add date range filters
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket for live dashboard updates
5. **Custom Views**: Save custom column orders and visibility

---

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check this documentation first
2. Verify data in database using MySQL queries
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Review backend logs for API errors
