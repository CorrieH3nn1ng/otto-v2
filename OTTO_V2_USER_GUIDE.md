## Package Splitting

**Purpose:** Split large packages when certain items need priority shipping or separate handling.

**Who Can Split:** Admin and Key Account Manager only

### How to Split a Package

1. Open invoice in edit mode
2. Go to "Invoices & Details" ‚Üí "Packing Details" tab
3. Find package to split
4. Click **Split** button (scissors icon)
5. Enter split quantities:
   - Gross weight (kg)
   - Net weight (kg)
   - Length (cm)
   - Width (cm)
   - Height (cm)
   - Contents description
6. System auto-calculates:
   - CBM (cubic meters)
   - Volumetric weight (CBM √ó 167)
7. Click "Split Package"

### What Happens When You Split

‚úÖ **Original package** keeps its file name, dimensions reduced
‚úÖ **New package** created with split quantities, empty file name
‚úÖ **All packages** renumbered sequentially (1, 2, 3...)
‚úÖ **Weights subtracted** from original package

### Validation Rules

- Cannot split more weight than original package
- Cannot split if package is on a manifest (locked)
- Must enter all dimension fields
- Gross weight must be ‚â• net weight

### Example Scenario

**Original Package:**
- Package #1: 1000 kg gross, 900 kg net
- File name: "KAMOA001"

**After Splitting 300 kg:**
- Package #1: 700 kg gross, 600 kg net, File: "KAMOA001"
- Package #2: 300 kg gross, 300 kg net, File: "" (empty)

You can then assign a different file name to Package #2 and transport separately.
